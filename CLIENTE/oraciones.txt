Loved this place.Crust is not good.Not tasty The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.Highly recommended.Waitress was a little slow in service.This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.did not like at all.The food, amazing.Service is also cute.So they performed.This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.The worst was the salmon sashimi.Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.Overall, I like this place a lot.The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.Ample portions and good prices.Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.Service sucks.The shrimp tender and moist.Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.It's too bad the food is so damn generic.The burger is good beef, cooked just right.Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.We'd definitely go back here again.We are so glad we found this place.A great way to finish a great.The service was meh.It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.The turkey and roast beef were bland.I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.We'll never go again.On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.Will go back next trip out.Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.I've had better atmosphere.Check it out.Good prices.Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.I wouldn't return.This place is way too overpriced or mediocre food.The management is rude.I had a seriously solid breakfast here.Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.Restaurant is always full but never a wait.The waitresses are very friendly.What I really like there is the crepe station.This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.The service here leaves a lot to be desired.Very good lunch spot.This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.this place is good.I was seated immediately.I've never been treated so bad.I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.We waited for forty five minutes in vain.the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.Bacon is hella salty.It was probably dirt.Interesting decor.Great brunch spot.Crostini that came with the salad was stale.Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.The warm beer didn't help.Must have been an off night at this place.calificacion de proyecto.es un domingo muy nublado.
